# harbor_config_security (Resource)

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "harbor_config_security" "main" {
  cve_allowlist = ["CVE-456", "CVE-123"]
  expires_at = "1701167767"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cve_allowlist` (List of String) System allowlist. Vulnerabilities in this list will be ignored when pushing and pulling images. Should be in the format or `["CVE-123", "CVE-145"]` or `["CVE-123"]`

### Optional

- `expires_at` (Number) The time for expiration of the allowlist, in the form of seconds since epoch. This is an optional attribute, if it's not set the CVE allowlist does not expire.

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (String) Time of creation of the list.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `update_time` (String) Time of update of the list.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax with the `registry` `id`:

```shell
# import using the id of the repo
terraform import harbor_config_security.main "7"
```
Note that at this point of time Harbor doesn't has any api endpoint for deleting this list. Only updating the records.
