## Schema

### Required

- `url` (String) The url of harbor
- `password` (String) The password to be used to access harbor
- `username` (String) The username to be used to access harbor

### Optional

- `api_version` (Number) Choose which version of the api you would like to use 1 or 2 (default is 2)
- `bearer_token` (String) The bearer token to be used to access harbor. Will take precedence over username and password if set
- `insecure` (Boolean) Choose to ignore certificate errors
- `robot_prefix` (String) Without this option, the provider will try to automatically determine the robot prefix with a call to the admin api. If you don't have admin access and want to create system robot account, you'll have to set this value.

### Environment variables
